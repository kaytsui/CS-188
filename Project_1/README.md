# Project 1

Project 1 was an introductory project that allowed students to get their feet "wet" by exposing them to a simple end-to-end data science notebook.

## Housing Regression
The first half of the notebook is an example the Teaching Assistants coded to show students what a typical end-to-end process looks like. 
Their example was focused on predicting housing prices in California. 

## Airbnb Regression
The second half of the notebook is what students had to code. Using the first half as reference, students had to implement an end-to-end process 
to train a linear regression model to predict Airbnb prices in New York.
